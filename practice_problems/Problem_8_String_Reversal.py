# Problem 8 - String Reversal

"""
Practice Problem: Write a program that takes a string and reverses it (e.g., “Python” becomes “nohtyP”).

Exercise Purpose: This exercise demonstrates “Sequence Slicing".
Strings in Python are sequences, and mastering the slicing syntax is a powerful shortcut for data manipulation that would take 5-10 lines of code in other languages.

Given Input: text = "Python"

Expected Output: Reversed: nohtyP

"""

# input word 
input = "Python"

# reverse input
rev_input = input [::-1] # reverse command

# print reversed input
print(f"Original Input: {input}")
print (f"Reversed Input: {rev_input}")
