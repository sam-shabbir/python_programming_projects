# Problem 6 - Calculating Factorial with a Loop

"""
Practice Problem: Write a program that calculates the factorial of a given number (e.g., 5!) using a for loop.

Exercise Purpose: This exercise explores “Mathematical Accumulation".
A factorial (e.g., 5! = 5*4*3*2*1) requires you to maintain a running product across multiple iterations, which is a core pattern in scientific computing.

Given Input: number = 5

Expected Output: The factorial of 5 is 120

"""

num = 5
factorial = 1

# Loop from 1 to num (inclusive) - A factorial (e.g., 5! = 5*4*3*2*1) 
for i in range(1, num + 1):
    factorial = factorial * i

print(f"The factorial of {num} is {factorial}")
