# Problem 7 - List Manipulation: Add & Remove

"""
Practice Problem: Create a list of 5 fruits. Add a new fruit to the end of the list, then remove the second fruit (at index 1).

Exercise Purpose: This exercise teaches “Dynamic Collection Management".
Lists are rarely static; being able to modify, expand, and prune them is essential for handling data like shopping carts, user lists, or inventory systems.

Given Input: fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

Expected Output: ['apple', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry', 'fig']

"""
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date", "elderberry"]

# Add a fruit to the end
fruits.append("fig")

# Remove the second fruit (index 1)
fruits.pop(1)

print(fruits)
